# intro objects relatioships.

'''
python offers a high degree of flexibility in defining classes objects.
with python, we can assign attributes and mthods classes and objects as well as add new aatributes to objects even after 
they have been instantiated.

additionally we can create classes that inherits attributea and methods from
a parent enabling children classes to receive those features.

However some relatioships between classes and objects are not as straightforward as parent-child relationships.
